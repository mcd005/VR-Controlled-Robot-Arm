Welcome to VLC for Unity on Windows!

## Docs reference

See the [LibVLCSharp documentation](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/blob/master/docs/home.md).

It includes [best practices](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/blob/master/docs/best_practices.md), [Q&A guide](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/blob/master/docs/how_do_I_do_X.md), [libvlc specific information](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/blob/master/docs/libvlc_documentation.md) and [tutorials](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/blob/master/docs/tutorials.md).

## Components included

For reference, you need to a bunch of components to get this working:
- libvlc.dll, libvlccore.dll (and its plugins in /plugins folder): These are nightly build DLLs of the VLC player libraries https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc
- Custom build of libvlcsharp, the official VideoLAN C# binding to libvlc https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp
- VLCUnityPlugin.dll, the VLC-Unity native plugin https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-unity

This is all included in this package and it all works automatically for you.

!! You need to set your Unity target platform to "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone" to target Windows classic. Go for the x86_64 architecture.

The scenes are located in `Assets/VLCUnity/Demos/Scenes` and provide a way to get started quickly. 

Select any scene (*.unity) and press play in the Unity Editor (or make a standalone build), and the video will start playing.

## Sample script 

The following information is to give you more context regarding what happens in the Demo scenes provided in the Asset.
Understanding the scripts will allow you to know where to look when customizing your own player.

Regarding the integration code that you need, you will find it in MinimalPlayback.cs.

First, you need to load the native libraries (libvlc):
```
Core.Initialize(UnityEngine.Application.dataPath);
```

You can then create LibVLCSharp objects like so:
```
LibVLC = new LibVLC();
MediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(LibVLC);
```

The frame updating is done in a Unity coroutine or Update() function:
```
IntPtr texptr = MediaPlayer.GetFrame(out bool updated);
if (updated)
{
    tex.UpdateExternalTexture(texptr);
}
```

See Update() function for more details.

Once that is all setup, you can create a new Media and start playback like so
```
MediaPlayer.Play(new Media(LibVLC, new Uri("http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4")));
```

To get up and running easily and quickly, I recommend you to load the Assets/VLCUnity/Demos/Scenes/MinimalPlayback.unity scene and press "Play". 
The few lines of setup code I mentioned above are located in Assets/VLCUnity/Demos/Scripts/MinimalPlayback.cs.
